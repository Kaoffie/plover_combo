# Plover Combo

A plugin for [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover) that adds a Combo counter. Inspired by the [Code in the Dark Editor](https://github.com/codeinthedark/editor).

`Ctrl/Cmd + S` to open settings, `Ctrl/Cmd + X` to close widget. Left click on the counter number and drag to move the widget around. (On some systems, you'll have to click on the opaque areas of the font.)
