# Plover Combo

A plugin for [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover) that adds a Combo counter. Inspired by the [Code in the Dark Editor](https://github.com/codeinthedark/editor).

`Ctrl + S` to open settings, `Ctrl + X` to close widget.

## Installation

This plugin isn't on the Plover Plugin Registry yet, so you'll have to install from source. I'll try to get it onto PyPI as soon as possible.
