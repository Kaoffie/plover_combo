A plugin for the open-source stenography software [Plover](https://www.openstenoproject.org) that adds a Combo counter. Inspired by the [Code in the Dark Editor](https://github.com/codeinthedark/editor).

## Usage Notes

- Shortcuts:
    - `Ctrl/Cmd + S` to open settings
    - `Ctrl/Cmd + X` to close widget. 

- Left click on the counter number and drag to move the widget around.
- After adjusting the settings, you might have to restart the plugin for all the changes to fully take effect.
- On Windows, the widget cannot be moved around by dragging on empty areas. To fix this, change the background opacity to 1.
- On macOS, you might experience repainting issues where a ghost image appears behind the counter. To fix this, turn on the "Force Repaint" option in the settings dialog.
- The window width is controlled by the width of the number currently displayed; to adjust the left and right padding, change the "Horizontal Margin" setting.

## Installation

You can install this plugin directly using the Plugin Manager, under the name `plover-combo`.
